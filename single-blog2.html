							<p class="first-letter">Three score and fifteen years ago the illustrious forefathers sacrificed their life to liberate our nation from the colonial rule of the British. Subsequently, the nation was founded on the four corner stones of Justice, liberty, equality and fraternity, the four major pillars of democracy. 75 years have passed since then. As I am speaking to you now, the great nation is passing through the toughest test of democracy.</p>
							
							<img src="img/Blogs/blog-002.jpg" alt="Blog Image" class="img-fluid img-full my-2" /> 					

							<p class="mt-3">According to the United Nations, more than 520 million people in India still live under the poverty line.  Bonded labor, regionalism, communalism, political assassinations, nepotism, scandals and scams are tearing the nation apart.  I am indeed sceptical about the future of the Indian democracy.  We need a change.  When I stand before you, I am reminded of an old song, which I hope will sum up the state of affairs in India.<br></p>
							<blockquote class="blockquote">
								<p class="mb-0">“I see a boat on the river sailing away down to the ocean where to I can’t say……”  Where are we heading to ?</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p class="mt-3">Let us now take a look at the track record of our democracy. Robbing our fragile nation of 6000 crores of rupees, killing innocent villagers simply because they belong to so called inferior caste are all the hallmarks of the day.  I shudder to relate our failures any further. Lincoln’s concept of democracy was “Of the people, for the people and by the people.” Have we, I am afraid, degraded our democratic system into OFF the people and BUY the people<br><br>
							Mahatma Gandhi wrote in the newspaper “The Harijan”, “A born democrat is a born disciplinarian” Alas, What a paradox; Today’s political arena is charged with communal and religious hatred, linguistic and ethnic discriminations.</p>

							<p class="mb-0">After about three quarters of  a century of our experiment with democracy, the scenario is n’t any better.  Nearly 60% of our women are illiterate and many more millions live in the gutters and slums without a canopy over their head. Friends, are we celebrating 75th year of chaos and poverty? Are we any better off than what we were 75 years ago? I leave the answer to the readers.<br><br>

							It is high time we took a second look at the existing  political system to one in which every citizen will have a say in choosing the country’s leader. The proliferation of parties on the basis of religion, region, caste, creed and language should cease. There are more than 250 registered parties in India.  As the adage goes, “Too many cooks spoil  the broth.”<br><br>

							I strongly feel that a bi-party system of govt is ideal for India. The American type of govt is something that we can try out. This every citizen has a role in electing the president and hence the president is directly responsible to the citizens. Every election guzzles Rs.2,500 crores. This amount should have been used for materializing our grand old dream of “roti”, “kapada” “makkan”. Unless we put an end to this perplexing political parody of peckish politicians, the Indian democracy will always remain a mirage. Let our experience be our best teacher; and let us not ride a horse that is blind. We are the hopes of tomorrow; we are the seeds of action. Let us emancipate our great nation, India, once again and give it a new lease of life. The cankerworm that eats into the social fabric of India is corruption-a perennial desire for accumulation of wealth.</p>
							<p class="mb-0"><br></p>								      						      

							<p class="mb-0"><br></p>
							<p class="mb-0">As Kenneth Kaunda wrote: “We should learn to despise accumulation of private wealth a little.”  It is here that the sentinels of democracy should borrow a leaf from Mahatma Gandhi who said, “My life is my message." For sure, India should change the track if it wants to keep itself abreast of the changing times.</p>
							<p class="mb-0"><br></p>
							
							<blockquote class="blockquote">
							<p class="mb-0"> Martin Luther Jr of America said “I have a dream” and my dream is a united India with a strong political system which can address all the major issues and lead us into the next millennium. </p>
							</blockquote>

							<p class="mb-0">Thank You! </p>
