							<p class="first-letter">“Coming together is a beginning, working together
													is success and keeping together is progress.”</p>

							<p class="mt-3">I would like to differ with those who think that progress is a modern myth. I don’t like to close my eyes and say that the world I live in a dark.  Similarly, I just can’t  admit that progress is a myth when I am enjoying the benefits of the progress we have made in all walks of human life.  Cast your eyes around.  You can see the wonders of our scientific advancements.  They are not myths, they are true and real. L The evolution of man from the Stone Age to the Space Age is not a myth.  A floral spaceship described in the ancient Hindus mythology centuries ago was thought to be a figment of imagination.  We have come a long way from there and today we are in a super-sonic and ultra-sonic age.  Can we call this technological feat a myth ? Nay can we ever turn a blind eye to this reality ? Never the celebrated South Indian poet Kumaranasan once wrote.</p>
							
							<img src="img/Blogs/blog-001.jpg" alt="Blog Image" class="img-fluid img-full my-2" /> 					
							<blockquote class="blockquote">
								<p class="mb-0">“A blunder that we did yesterday could become the  science today and may be the custom of tomorrow.”</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p class="mt-3">Those who see no progress around them are pessimists who create darkness by closing their own eyes.  For them, progress has two sides:  spiritual and material. Their allegation is that although human beings have made substantial progress in scientific and technological fields, they are spiritually despondent.  According to them, our society has slipped into a whirlpool of moral degradation. permissiveness, drunkenness and material pursuits that are the hallmarks of the present moribund civilization. In the past, there were times when people were morally bankrupt and spiritually mendicant, but there were spiritual leaders like Prophet Moses and Prophet Abraham to lead the people to the oasis of faith. Of course, they profited both spiritually and materially. This is an example of spiritual progress.<br><br>
							We do not have to look beyond to prove that progress is not a myth. The communication gadgets such as the public address system, telephone and computer are just a few examples of our scientific achievements. The areas of communication, aviation, and automobile have benefitted us most because of man’s irresistible thirst for innovation and improvement. As days pass by, the world is getting smaller and smaller, but paradoxically the people are getting farther. As Lord Tennyson puts it, “The old order changeth yielding place to new.” Progress is an inherent phenomenon of every animate object. We just can’t ignore it as myth.<br><br>
							Like everything else, progress has two sides, too: the destructive and the constructive. It is the user who decides which side of progress should be used for his benefit.  For instance, Einstein had never thought his scientific theory, E = MC 2 , would be capable of annihilating the human race. It is we who translated the theory into a potentially  destructive. As Milton observes, “we can make a hell our of heaven, or a heaven out of hell.” Hence my dear friends, progress is not a modern myth, but a reality as concrete as the Himalayas.</p>
							
							<p class="mb-0">As the Bhagawad Geetha says, change is the law of nature and no force on earth can stop it. So to say, progress is inextricably associated with change and without change the  planet will be yet another planet, inhabited only by prehistoric and primitive species. Finding solutions to human problems is progress.  The unflagging determination has vanquished  many dreadful diseases such as polio, tuberculosis, tetanus and rabbies are just a few. Human being are becoming masters of their own destiny with the quantum leap they have made in genetic engineering and cloning. These achievements are not myths.<br><br>

							Thnik of a world without progress. It is not a place worth living. With progress our world is vibrant, dynamic and promising.  The caution man has to bear in mind is that he should not allow progress to over power him, instead progress should be under his command. When we fail in this, man becomes a slave to man-made objects and comforts.<br><br>
